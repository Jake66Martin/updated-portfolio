          My name is Jacob-Fournier Martin, and I am an aspiring web developer in the making!
          I am currently enrolled within the Carleton University coding bootcamp academy.
          I am a curious individual who is constantly looking to absorb material in order to grow
          and develop my knowledge base. I have deep interests in the tech field, the STEM fields,
          philosophy, psychology etc. I am also a big reader, ranging from fiction to non-ficton, over
          a plethora of subjects and genres. As you can tell, I also have a bit of a sense of humour.

              Hello to you! Yes, you, the individual that is reading this. I see
              that you have come across my portfolio... Be it either a potential
              employer, or a potential client. For which ever reason it may be,
              you are now here. Enter the portfolio!

              My name is Jacob-Fournier Martin, and I am an aspiring web
              developer in the making! I am currently enrolled within the
              Carleton University coding bootcamp academy. I am a curious
              individual who is constantly looking to absorb material in order
              to grow and develop my knowledge base. I have deep interests in
              the tech field, the STEM fields, philosophy, psychology etc. I am
              also a big reader, ranging from fiction to non-ficton, over a
              plethora of subjects and genres. As you can tell, I also have a
              bit of a sense of humour.
